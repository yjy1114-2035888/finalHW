The data used in the Shiny app is the "2018 Central Park Squirrel Census" dataset, which contains information about Eastern gray squirrels observed in Central Park, including their location, behavior, age, and fur color.

The Shiny app has several tabs, including an "About" tab that provides general information about the dataset, and a "Plot" tab that allows users to create a scatterplot of squirrel sightings in Central Park, with the ability to filter by fur color using a select input widget.

The app also has a "Table" tab that displays a table of the filtered data, with the ability to filter by behavior using a checkbox group input widget, and to sort the table by clicking on column headers. The "Table" tab also includes a text output that displays the number of observations in the selected subset. The sidebar panel in the "Table" tab contains the select input widget for filtering by fur color, as well as the checkbox group input widget for filtering by behavior.
